TO DO
=====

Questions
---------
- is where way to provide error message instead of just returning "no match"
  in case amount of parens less than args[] size?
  * use NumberOfCapturingGroups() to check?

- how to get regex syntax error? RE2.error() + RE2.error_arg()?

- what exactly mean "3..16 args" comment for PartialMatchN() in re2.h?

- how to use named parens?
  * use NamedCapturingGroups() to map names to indices?

Planned Features
----------------
- add Replace() and GlobalReplace()

- add QuoteMeta()

- add ability to compile regex and use already compiled regex
  * how to send RE2 type to limbo? or cache it in libre2wrap with some
    additional API to free unused regex from cache?

- add FindAndConsumeN()
  * how to keep StringPiece() around limbo's string between calls to
    FindAndConsumeN()?

Unplanned Features
------------------
- add Extract() and PossibleMatchRange()? not sure is them really useful...

- FullMatch(), PartialMatch() support - use N-versions of these
  functions instead

- FullMatchN() support - why not just use PartialMatch() with ^ and $ ?

- Consume() support - why not just use FindAndConsume() with ^ ?

- return paren's content as non-string type (int, etc.) - ease to
  convert to wanted type at any time later in limbo
