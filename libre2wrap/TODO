TO DO
=====

Questions
---------
- what exactly mean "3..16 args" comment for PartialMatchN() in re2.h?

- how to use named parens?
  * use NamedCapturingGroups() to map names to indices?

Planned Features
----------------

Unplanned Features
------------------
- add FindAndConsumeN()
  * how to keep StringPiece() around limbo's string between calls to
    FindAndConsumeN()?
  * is it really needed in addition to current implementation?

- add Extract() and PossibleMatchRange()? not sure is them really useful...

- FullMatch(), PartialMatch() support - use N-versions of these
  functions instead

- FullMatchN() support - why not just use PartialMatch() with ^ and $ ?

- Consume() support - why not just use FindAndConsume() with ^ ?

- return paren's content as non-string type (int, etc.) - ease to
  convert to wanted type at any time later in limbo
